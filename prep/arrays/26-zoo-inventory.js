//Define a function, zooInventory, that accepts a multi-dimensional array of 
//animal facts.

//zooInventory should return a new, flat array of strings. Each element in 
//the new array should be a sentence about each of the animals in the zoo.

//Hint: nested for-loops are not necessary to complete this problem. This 
//would be a great time to use template literals, also known as string 
//interpolation.
